## Looking back on starting a meadery

Most things become clearer with hindsight and now that i'm a few months removed from the opening of my small business I finally have some thoughts worth sharing. While I was in the thick of it the amount of "stuff" that needed to happen simply overwhelmed me and I just got into the mode of fixing whatever was in front of me without a lot of planning. I had plans of course but they were pretty vague. Just getting things moving was so hard.

I like to think of starting a business like a rickety lawnmower you're trying to start on a hot summer day. You keep pulling on the cord to get the motor to catch and it seems like its going to work every time, just over a year and a half of that. Its not fun.

But lets step back...

Two Seasons Meadery is a small craft beverage producer in Anchorage, Alaska. We make mead which is an alcoholic beverage made from honey. My friends and I have always enjoyed mead and there used to be two local producers in Alaska. One was in Homer but closed because of family issues, and the other was in Anchorage but got bought out and relocated to Talkeetna. You can still find mead from them in town but the new owners haven't done much with the property or opened an Anchorage location so it felt like mead had died in Anchorage.
My friend Vince and I talked about opening our own Meadery but the idea got shelved like so many ideas do, and we largely just forgot about it for years. I think our earliest discussions about it were in 2015 or 2016. 

A few years passed and I started getting burnt out at work. Most of my friends were all feeling similarly and the meadery idea came up again. By this time we had met Kevin who was working at King Street Brewery and he had been independently thinking about opening a Meadery. Riley, who is the last member of our TSM crew was also working at King Street and we all got to know one another. I think it was Riley who eventually called the question - why don't we stop talking about it, and open this Meadery?
I'd like to say that we jumped right into it at that point, but no it still took us another 3-6 months of chatting to really get to the point of deciding that yes, lets do it. This was early 2018.
