There is no real theme to my latest playlist. It started out with some core songs and stitching them together in a few different ways until I was satisfied. 
Foxes' [If You Leave Me Now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO0CBzZopaY) was the first song in the list and paired with the always brilliant Adele in [When We Were Young](https://youtu.be/DDWKuo3gXMQ?t=42) I had strong female singers to build everything else around. 
Cataline, Strumbellas, and Jack Garret are other highlights.
